description: "Cleopatra: Being an Account of the Fall and Vengeance of Harmachis is\
  \ a novel written by the author H. Rider Haggard, the author of King Solomon's Mines\
  \ and She.\nThe book was first printed in 1889.\nThe story is set in the Ptolemaic\
  \ era of Ancient Egyptian history and revolves around the survival of a dynasty\
  \ bloodline protected by the Priesthood of Isis. The main character Harmachis (the\
  \ living descendant of the pharaoh's bloodline) is charged by the Priesthood to\
  \ overthrow the supposed impostor Cleopatra, drive out the Greeks and Romans and\
  \ restore Egypt to its golden era.\nAs is the case with the majority of Haggard's\
  \ works, the story draws heavily upon adventure and exotic concepts. The story,\
  \ told from the point of view of the Egyptian priest Harmachis, is recounted in\
  \ biblical language, being in the form of papyrus scrolls found in a tomb. Haggard's\
  \ portrait of Cleopatra is quite stunning, revealing her wit, her treachery, and\
  \ her overwhelming presence. All of the characters are mixtures of good and evil,\
  \ and evoke both sympathy and loathing. While much of the material on ancient Egyptian\
  \ ritual is overdone, the often brilliant dialogue and the fateful interactions\
  \ between the principal characters make the book quite unforgettable in comparison\
  \ to Haggard's better known but more conventional adventure novels. The character\
  \ of Mark Antony, introduced in the later part of the book, is fleeting and lacks\
  \ importance, though historically it seems that the book has some importance as\
  \ the references made are based on facts about the romance between Cleopatra and\
  \ Mark Antony and the fall of both from power. Cleopatra goes unrecognized in most\
  \ discussions of Haggardâ€”perhaps because of its stilted language.\nBoucher and McComas\
  \ gave the novel a mixed review, saying that it combined \"a not always believable\
  \ portrait\" of its title heroine with a \"fascinating, wholly convincing\" story\
  \ line.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
